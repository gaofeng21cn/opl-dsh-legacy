/**
 * Event-driven waiting for one Session to reach a terminal state.
 *
 * A caller that wants to know "has this Session finished, failed, been
 * cancelled, or stopped for input?" must not poll the log. Every one of those
 * facts is already published: `turn/end` is a durable Session event carrying a
 * `TurnEndReason`, and the approval audit pair (`approval/asked` /
 * `approval/decided`) brackets the one interactive pause a tool call can enter.
 *
 * The wait observes those facts through a Session projection, and resolves the
 * instant the live `session/event` feed delivers the one it is waiting for.
 * Reading the position it starts from goes through the same projection rather
 * than a synchronous scan of the event log: a synchronous historical read is
 * prohibited for new code because it makes behavior depend on the whole event
 * sequence staying resident in memory.
 *
 * The wait is a pure observer: it appends nothing, holds no service, and
 * resolves exactly once. Caller cancellation removes the listeners and rejects.
 *
